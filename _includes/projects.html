    <h3> Work </h3>
    <p> I'm currently at Google Research in New York, focusing on Natural Language Understanding. I recently released my first coauthored paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08962">Well-Read Students Learn Better: On the Importance of Pre-training Compact Models</a>. Previously, I worked on <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html">Federated Learning</a> at Google Research in Seattle.

    <h3> Education </h3>
    I graduated with an MSc in Computer Science at the University of Oxford, at Magdalen College, where I wrote my dissertation on <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Statistica.html?id=P4l4rgEACAAJ">Recurrent Neural Networks for Statistical Machine Translation</a>. Prior to that, I graduated with a BA in Computer Science from University of Cambridge, at Newnham College.
